 * Backup any Sqlite3 Database incrementally. For simple use case, just call this function as `backup('<Your Database File>')`. Refer to documentation for more.
 * @param {string} sourceDb The input file name of the database which should be backed up. ***PLEASE USE AN UNIQUE FILENAME FOR EACH BACKUP***. Defaults to `snapshot-<current_timestamp>.txt`.
 * @param {string} snapshotName The name of the snapshot name. This file contains the references the objects (saves).
 * @param {string} objDir The directory where all the objects will be generated. The script must have right permission to that folder. For consistency, please use the same directory where the previous call of the API generated. Otherwise it would not be useful at all. It defaults to `objects/`.
